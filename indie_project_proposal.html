  <head> Independant Project Proposal </head>
  <h2> Project Name </h2>
  <br>
  <p> JMU Libraries App </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Overview (Scope of Work)</h2>
  <br>
  <p> For my independent project, I will be researching and designing an application that will help students locate books in the JMU Libraries. I will primarily focus on Carrier Library since the timeline of this project is so short.</p>
  <br>
  <h2> Goals (including issues related to Technically Wrong)</h2>
  <br>
  <p> My goal in relation to Technically Wrong is to create an application that makes taking advantage of the libraries' resources easier on students and faculty. 
    From working there, I notice most that people struggle to locate books within the buildings and frequently as for help. 
    This shows me that the current system (of posters/ explaination from staff) of location is not working for our users. 
   In my application, I will use a map feature that allows you to have a visual representation of where a book is located, and directions on how to find it. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Audience</h2>
  <br>
  <p> My primary audience will be the JMU community including students, faculty and staff. This group of people will be the focus of my design.
    My secondary audience would be what we call "community lenders". These are people in the local community that have a Massennutten Regional Library Card and can use such to borrow materials from JMU. </p>
